# pFTPfse â€“ Perl (based) FTP File Search Engine

This is my first open-source project (missed 10 years anniversary this summer..).
Decided to put it on GitHub to (re)share some write-only Perl code and to remember
good ol' days :)

## Why so strange name?

Back in those days it was kinda popular to prefix software with technology it
depends on (p* for Perl, py* for Python, g* from Gnome, k* for KDE, etc).

*FTP* speaks for itself.

*fse*.. Well.. just look at [wu-ftpd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WU-FTPD).
When you know what's it about, it's sounds trivial :)
